# VOIDMARE Team

VOIDMARE Team is an indie development group focused on creating the VOIDMARE game series using Go and Ebiten. We prioritize fun and challenging gameplay while providing tools and workflows that allow contributors—level designers, script creators, and artists—to focus on their craft without needing to modify the core code.
