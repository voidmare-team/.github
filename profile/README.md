# VOIDMARE Team

VOIDMARE Team is an indie development group focused on creating the VOIDMARE game series. 

The team prioritizes fun and challenging gameplay, while providing tools and workflows that allow contributors—level designers, script creators, 
and artists—to focus on their craft without touching the code.
